# IMDb Top 250 Movies Dashboard in Power BI

## Project Overview

This is my first dashboard project built with Power BI, focusing on analyzing a dataset of IMDb’s Top 250 Movies. The project aimed to explore movie ratings, audience engagement, and trends over time using Power BI’s powerful visualization capabilities.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Power BI**: The core tool used for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Utilized to create custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis.
- **Visual Charts**: A variety of charts were used to represent key insights, including donut charts, bar charts, and line charts.
- **Slicers**: Implemented to allow for interactive filtering of the dashboard data.
- **Custom Formatting**: Applied to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the dashboard.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard was designed to track the following metrics:

| KPI                  | Value        | Insight                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Total Votes** | 1.1M         | Reflects strong audience engagement.    |
| **Average Rating** | 8.3          | Indicates high-quality content.         |
| **Total Movies** | 250          | A concise and rich dataset for analysis. |

## Key Insights and Recommendations

Based on the dashboard’s visualization, the following insights and recommendations were identified:

### 1. Top Age Groups
- **Insight**: Most of the top 250 movies are rated “R”, followed by “PG” and “PG-13”.
- **Recommendation**: This suggests a strong focus on adult-oriented content within the top-rated movies. A deep dive into top-rated “R” movies could reveal genre-specific insights.

### 2. Number of Movies per Year
- **Insight**: There is a notable spike in the number of top-rated movies in the early 2000s.
- **Recommendation**: This could indicate a “golden era” of modern cinema. Further analysis could compare rating trends across different decades.

### 3. Age Group Distribution
- **Insight**: “R” ratings dominate across various visuals, showing a clear trend towards mature themes.
- **Recommendation**: In future versions, the analysis could be expanded to include genres, directors, and box office performance to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these trends.
